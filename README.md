For the best experience view on web (although mobile works too just not as much, autoplay not compatible on iOS, although android should be fine.)

## Overview

A decentralized social media platform is a fun way for people to show each other what they are doing, or to share things they find funny or interesting. Other people can watch the videos and leave comments, or "like" them if they enjoy them creating social interactions and community.

We set out to build a social media that cares more about the user, that wonâ€™t harvest user data (looking at you Tiktok!) and gives the content creator control over their own content.

For full transparency we started to build Manor as part of the Encode/WBW3 accelerator, the Next Build Hackathon began a week or so into it and we were encouraged to enter, and so have been building for both alongside each other. We have added new features since it finished in mid December. Manor is also taking part in Buildspace N&W S2.

1. Landing page, you will land on the for you page where you will find a timeline of videos to scroll through. Want a different view? there is a second timeline of the 'Latest' video posts also available and some suggested accounts to look at.

2. The best way to experience Manor is to connect your wallet and login with Lens.

3. If you need a testnet Lens handle, we gotchu, youâ€™ll find the link to easily mint one at the bottom of the sidebar. It takes you to [Lens-do-it](https://lens-do-it.vercel.app/), created by our dev @paolo to easily mint a testnet handle.

4. Social sharing: now you can interact and Follow(or unfollow), Like, Comment, Collect, Upload, using these buttons. You can also now see who you follow, click on their profile, see what they're up to

5. Clicking upload will bring you here: Select the file you want to upload, choose a title and description. you can also choose to use the Lens collect module here to put a condition on your video collects. Choose to allow anyone or only followers and set a price or leave it free.

5.5) Uploading: budlr is a bit funny. You need to hvae a storage balance with them in order to upload. So the first time you will have zero and will need to depoist (not much, and its mumbai not real Matic). PRess the black depoist button, enter the amount you want, click the second deposit button and then wait for it to refresh. We show you an estimate of how much it'll cost to upload the video so you know how much to top up.

7. Commenting: Click on a video or the comment button to get to this page where you can leave a comment. Toggle to encrypt it (using LIT protocol) so only the creator can see it.

8. Search: sort of self explanatory, start typing the name or handle of a user into the search bar, and some profiles will come up, click through to see their profile

## Conclusion

Our aim when building Manor was to try and make a contribution to a more decentralised social media, where users donâ€™t have to worry about their data, and where they have full control over their content.

Manor is built on chain and so is by nature decentralised, it uses decentralised protocols such as Lens and Livepeer. This means greater privacy and security for users, as their data is not stored on a central server that could be vulnerable to hacking or other security threats.

In addition to the core social features, Manor also includes the Lens collect module. This feature allows users to take more control over their content.
Comments, encrypted with Lit Protocol give further user control on both the creator and user side.
